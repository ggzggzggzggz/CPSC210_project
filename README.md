# A to-do list application

## Propose

- Keep track of things to do
- Cross things off
- Different views *all items, or just completed items, or only outstanding items*

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a task to my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of tasks on my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as complete on my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a task from my to-do-list
- As a user, I want to be able to save the state of the application
- As a user, I want to be able to reload that state from file and resume exactly where they left off at some earlier time

## Phase 4: Task 2
In ToDoList class and deleteTask method that has a robust design.

## Phase 4: Task 3
I think if I have more time, I want JsonReader and JsonWriter to connect ToDoList rather than ListDemo. I think other parts of UML looks good.
